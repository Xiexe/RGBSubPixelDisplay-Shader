# RGBSubPixelDisplay-Shader
A physically accurate screen shader, that displays the screen as subpixels. 

Set the tiling of the texture to whatever the resolution of your screen is divided by two. 

My texture contains 6 subpixels, two of each color, so you would have two whole pixels. 

A 4K resolution of 3840 x 2160 with this specific texture would be a tiling of 1920 x 1080.
